# Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

A curated collection of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugins for **Drupal development, security, and deployment**. Each plugin covers one topic — Drupal itself, DDEV, Docker, CI/CD, git workflows, and security verification — so you install only what you need.

### drupal-dev-tools

Comprehensive Drupal 11 toolkit:

- **Slash command `/drupal-dev-tools:drupal`** — full code audit of custom themes and modules: Drupal 11 standards, security (SQL injection, XSS, unsafe input), SOLID/DRY design review, duplication, refactoring recommendations.
- **Skills** — `drupal-module-development`, `drupal-security-review`.

### ddev-tools

DDEV is a multiplatform local development environment (built on Docker), so it has its own plugin:

- **Agent `drupal-ddev`** — manages DDEV-based Drupal 11 projects: modules, configuration, database operations, caches, Composer workflows.
- **`drupal-ddev-operations`** — safe operational workflows for Drupal in DDEV: backup-first updates, database/config import-export, troubleshooting.

### git-tools

- **`git-worktree`** — check out multiple branches into separate directories so parallel tasks (or parallel Claude sessions) never conflict. Covers create/list/remove/move/repair, agent workflow, and safety rules.

### security-tools

- **`owasp-asvs`** — OWASP ASVS v5.0 verification checklist (V1–V14) with every requirement mapped to Drupal 11 APIs (`Xss::filter()`, Query Builder, Flood control, Key module…), critical security patterns in PHP, red-flags table, and recommended Drupal security modules.

### docker-tools

- **`docker-compose`** — compose.yaml authoring and operations with a Drupal stack (php-fpm, nginx, MariaDB, Redis) as the working example: healthchecks, depends_on conditions, dev/prod override files, profiles, troubleshooting.
- **`docker-model`** — Docker Model Runner: pull/run local AI models, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, the Compose `models:` element, and using it as a local backend for the Drupal AI module.

### cicd-tools

- **`gitlab-ci`** — `.gitlab-ci.yml` authoring for Drupal: composer caching, phpcs/phpstan/phpunit jobs with a MariaDB service, `rules:`, environments, and drush-based deployment.
- **`github-actions`** — workflows for Drupal: least-privilege permissions, concurrency, matrix PHP builds, database services, reusable workflows, and SSH/drush deployment.

### workflow-tools

Phased development workflows that orchestrate the other plugins' skills, with rigor scaled to the risk of the task:

- **`feature-workflow`** — gated plan → implement → review → test → finalize procedure for non-trivial Drupal changes. Classifies the task first (standard / security-sensitive / schema-touching) and adds a mandatory security pass or update-hook requirement accordingly. Uses `drupal-module-development`, the `/drupal-dev-tools:drupal` audit, and `owasp-asvs` when those plugins are installed, with documented manual fallbacks when they are not.
- **`deploy-workflow`** — safe deployment sequence: pre-flight config-status check, mandatory backup, `composer install` → `drush updb` → `drush cim` → `drush cr` (or `drush deploy`), post-deploy verification, and a rollback plan. Covers per-site update passes for multisite releases.
- **`tiny-fix`** — deliberately minimal path for typos, CSS tweaks, and single-line changes, with an escalation tripwire to `feature-workflow` the moment a change touches logic, config, security, or schema.

## Installation

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

In Claude Code, run the following command to add this plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add siva01c/claude-plugins
```

### Step 2: List Available Plugins

View all plugins available in the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace list
```

### Step 3: Install Plugins

Install any plugin with `/plugin install <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>`:

```
/plugin install drupal-dev-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install ddev-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install git-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install security-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install docker-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install cicd-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install workflow-tools@dev-tools
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Check that the plugins are installed:

```
/plugin list
```

## Updating Plugins

Pushing new commits to this repository does **not** automatically update an already-installed plugin. Claude Code keeps a local cache of both the marketplace catalog and the installed plugin (pinned to a specific git commit), so you have to refresh them manually.

### Step 1: Refresh the Marketplace Catalog

Fetch the latest catalog from this repository:

```
/plugin marketplace update dev-tools
```

The format is: `/plugin marketplace update <marketplace-name>`. Use `--all` to refresh every marketplace at once.

### Step 2: Update the Installed Plugin

Refreshing the catalog does not change the installed copy on its own. Reinstall the plugin to pull the latest version:

```
/plugin uninstall drupal-dev-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install drupal-dev-tools@dev-tools
```

### Step 3: Reload Plugins

Activate the changes in your current session (or restart Claude Code):

```
/reload-plugins
```

### Optional: Enable Auto-Update

To have the marketplace pull the latest version automatically on startup:

1. Run `/plugin`
2. Open the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Select your marketplace
4. Toggle **Enable auto-update**

### Tip: Local Development

If you are developing this plugin locally, add the marketplace from your local working tree instead of GitHub. This avoids the push/fetch cycle — you only need `/reload-plugins` to test edits:

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-plugins
```

## Upgrading from 1.0 to 2.0

Version 2.0 (git tag `2.0`) restructures the marketplace from a single plugin into six topic-based plugins. The `drupal-dev-tools` plugin no longer contains the multiplatform tooling — it moved to dedicated plugins:

| Item | 1.0 location | 2.0 location |
|---|---|---|
| git-worktree skill | `drupal-dev-tools:git-worktree` | `git-tools:git-worktree` |
| owasp-asvs skill | `drupal-dev-tools:owasp-asvs` | `security-tools:owasp-asvs` |
| drupal-ddev agent | `drupal-dev-tools` | `ddev-tools` |
| drupal-ddev-operations skill | `drupal-dev-tools:drupal-ddev-operations` | `ddev-tools:drupal-ddev-operations` |

Version 2.0 also adds two brand-new plugins: `docker-tools` (Docker Compose, Docker Model Runner) and `cicd-tools` (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).

### Upgrade steps

Run these commands in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace update dev-tools
/plugin uninstall drupal-dev-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install drupal-dev-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install ddev-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install git-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install security-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install docker-tools@dev-tools
/plugin install cicd-tools@dev-tools
/reload-plugins
```

Notes:

- Reinstalling `drupal-dev-tools` is **required** — it removes the relocated agent and skills from the old installed copy.
- Install `ddev-tools`, `git-tools`, and `security-tools` to keep the agent and skills you used in 1.0.
- `docker-tools` and `cicd-tools` are new in 2.0 — install only if you need them.
- If you pinned the marketplace to a local directory, replace step 1 with re-adding the marketplace from the updated checkout.

## Changelog

### 2.1 (Latest)

- **New `workflow-tools` plugin:** phased `feature-workflow` (plan/implement/review/test/finalize with task classification), `deploy-workflow` (backup-first deployment sequence with multisite support and rollback), and `tiny-fix` (low-ceremony path with escalation tripwire). Workflows reference skills from the other plugins when installed and degrade gracefully when they are not.

### 2.0
- **Restructured into topic-based plugins:** `git-worktree` moved to new `git-tools` plugin, `owasp-asvs` moved to new `security-tools` plugin, `drupal-ddev` agent + `drupal-ddev-operations` skill moved to new `ddev-tools` plugin (DDEV is multiplatform, not Drupal-specific)
- **New `docker-tools` plugin:** Docker Compose (Drupal stack) and Docker Model Runner skills
- **New `cicd-tools` plugin:** GitLab CI and GitHub Actions skills for Drupal pipelines
- `drupal-dev-tools` plugin bumped to 4.0.0 (breaking: agent and skills moved out — plugin versions are independent of repo tags)
- Marketplace metadata refocused on Drupal development, security, and deployment
- See [Upgrading from 1.0 to 2.0](#upgrading-from-10-to-20)

### 1.0 — original single-plugin marketplace
- Single `drupal-dev-tools` plugin (up to 2.2.0) containing the audit command, DDEV agent, and all skills including `git-worktree` and `owasp-asvs`
- Plugin 2.2.0: added the Drupal-focused reusable skills bundle (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)
- Plugin 2.1.0: comprehensive code audit command, improved DDEV agent workflows, updated security analysis patterns
